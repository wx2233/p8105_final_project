* (Regression Model)

<br />

* We do find some very meaningful trends using our dataset. 
  + First, avoid accident prone **hours and holidays**. Accidents are more likely to happen during rush hours, while the most fatal ones happen early in the morning (6 o'clock) and at night (9 oâ€™clock). Moreover, holiday weekends are more traffic prone. 
  + Second, have good **driving habits**. Keep safe distance and backing up safely are always the keys to prevent a large proportion of accidents. In addition, one should always pay special attention when changing lanes in Manhattan. 
  + Third, stay away from bad **weather**, as more accidents are likely to happen during severe weather. 

<br />

* There are also some shortages associated with the *Motor Vehicle Collisions* dataset. 
  + We faced issues of missing data and non uniform observation names when we are trying to analyze *contributing factors* and *vehicle types*. 
    + The second highest contributing factor is unspecified, but knowing the right *contributing factors* could play a crucial rule when trying to reduce car accident numbers. Also, most *vehicle types* are recorded in different ways, which increased the difficulty to classify them. Better conclusion could be drawn if better data collecting mechanism is adopted.  

<br />

We hope by doing this analysis, people could travel more safely and wisely in New York City.
